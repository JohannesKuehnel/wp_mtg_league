# MTG League Tracker
MTG League Tracker is a Wordpress Plugin to display standings for trading card game [Magic: The Gathering](https://magic.wizards.com/) leagues and tournaments. Initially developed for the [Austrian Magic Championship](https://www.austrianmagic.at/), MTG League Tracker could be useful for similar projects.
The plugin relies on [The Events Calendar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-events-calendar/) to handle events. Tournament result files (XML) from [Wizard Event Reporter](https://wpn.wizards.com/wer) (WER) can then be uploaded. Standings are automatically updated and displayable via shortcodes.
