# MTG League Tracker
MTG League Tracker is a Wordpress Plugin to display standings for trading card game Magic: The Gathering [1] leagues and tournaments.
The plugin relies on [The Events Calendar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-events-calendar/) [2] to handle events. Tournament result files (XML) from Wizard Event Reporter (WER) [3] can then be uploaded. Standings are automatically updated and displayable via shortcodes.
